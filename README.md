jQuery Star Wars Game

This is a Star Wars RPG game. 

Select the character that you want to be, which will turn the other characters into defenders.

Once the defenders are set, you can select from them to become the primary defender.

Make sure you utilize strategy as you can be easily defeted by the wrong plan of attack.

While you gain strength from attacking the enemies their attacks will remain constant, so while you can gain strength as you power through enemies if you take them on in the wrong order you will be overwhelmed and defeated.

Enjoy this simple take on an RPG game that was built with sweat tears and jQuery.
